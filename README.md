# Lab-bot 
Rule-based lab report explainer with Marathi MT, TTS & WhatsApp delivery

Lab-bot is an end-to-end system that takes a **digital lab report PDF**, extracts test values and reference ranges, generates a **safe English explanation**, translates it to **Marathi**, produces **audio**, and sends text + audio to patients via the **WhatsApp Cloud API** (developer mode).

It is designed for a small hospital setting where many patients are more comfortable in the local Indian Language than in English.
